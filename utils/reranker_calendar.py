    Rerank calendar documents using LLM-based relevance scoring.
    
    This function takes a list of calendar events and tasks retrieved from
    semantic search and reranks them based on semantic relevance to the user's
    query using an LLM. It formats the documents for the LLM, gets relevance
    scores, and returns the documents sorted by relevance.

    You are an assistant that ranks calendar items based on relevance to user questions.

    User:
    QUESTION: "{query}"

    CANDIDATES (each line starts with an index):
    {block}

    # INSTRUCTIONS
    1. For each candidate, assign a RELEVANCE score from 0 to 1:
        - 1.0 = Perfectly matches the question
        - 0.7-0.9 = Highly relevant 
        - 0.4-0.6 = Moderately relevant
        - 0.1-0.3 = Weakly relevant
        - 0.0 = Not relevant at all

    2. ONLY include candidates with score â‰¥ 0.4 in your output.
    3. If NO candidate scores â‰¥ 0.4, return an empty list [].
    4. Be strict - only return truly relevant items for the specific question.

    ## RELEVANCE GUIDELINES FOR SPORTS QUERIES
    - If question asks about "sport" or "sports": ONLY return events that are clearly sports-related
    - Sports keywords: soccer, football, basketball, tennis, hockey, game, match, tournament
    - Sports locations: stadium, field, court, arena, gym (NOT offices, conference rooms)
    - Business events at sports venues are NOT sports activities

    ## RANKING RULES
    - If the question contains "event", "summit", "conference", "seminar", etc. events outrank tasks.
    - If the question contains "task", "to-do", "deadline", etc. tasks outrank events.

    ## OUTPUT FORMAT
    Return ONLY a JSON array of indices, ordered by relevance.
    Examples: [0, 2, 1] or [1] or []

    Do NOT include explanations or other text.
